# RUNNING LOCALLY
- run `npm install`
- run `npm start`

# LIBRARY USAGE
- I've used `TypeScript` because it saves time on debugging.
- `@reduxjs/toolkit` as it's modern and more comfortable than plain `react-redux`. Since `@reduxjs/toolkit` uses `react-redux` under the hood I believe I think I completed the task according to the requirements, but, if you insist, I can rework this task with plain `react-redux`.
- `antd` for easy pagination.
- `react-select` for easy select setting.
- `styled-components` for styling, because I'm very familiar with it.

# ADDITIONAL NOTES
Design may seem old-fashioned, but so is Star Wars styling. I tried to keep the spirit of Star Wars.
<br>Thank you for your time :)
